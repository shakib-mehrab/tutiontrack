## üåê Vercel Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Production ready deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Generate PWA Icons:**
   - Use [PWA Builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator) to generate icons
   - Upload a 512x512 source image
   - Download all icon sizes
   - Place them in `public/icons/` directory

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Install Vercel CLI (Optional):**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy via Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - In Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add all variables from your `.env.local` file
   - Make sure to add them for all environments (Development, Preview, Production)

4. **Configure Custom Domain (Optional):**
   - In Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
   - Add your custom domain
   - Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` to match your domain

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Ensure build completes without errors
   - Check for any warnings that need attention

2. **Test Core Functionality:**
   - User registration and login
   - Dashboard access (teacher/student)
   - Tuition creation and management
   - PDF generation
   - Delete functionality

3. **Test PWA Features:**
   - Install prompt appears
   - App works offline (basic functionality)
   - Icons display correctly
   - Standalone mode works

## üì± PWA Verification

### 1. Chrome DevTools Audit
1. Open your deployed app in Chrome
2. Press F12 ‚Üí Lighthouse tab
3. Run PWA audit
4. Ensure all criteria are met

### 2. Mobile Testing
1. Test on actual mobile devices
2. Verify install prompt appears
3. Test offline functionality
4. Check icon and splash screen

### 3. App Stores (Optional)
- You can submit PWAs to Microsoft Store
- Google Play Store (via TWA - Trusted Web Activity)

## üîí Security Checklist
